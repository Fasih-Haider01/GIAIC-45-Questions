//Stripping Names: Store a personâ€™s name, and include some whitespace characters at the beginning and end of the name.
//Make sure you use each character combination, "\t" and "\n", at least once. 
//Print the name once, so the whitespace around the name is displayed. 
//Then print the name after striping the white spaces.
